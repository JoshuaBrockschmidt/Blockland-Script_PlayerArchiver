This add-on keeps a record of players BLID's, names, and the number of times
you've encountered them. Data is collected from all players present on a server
when you connect to it, as well as every time a player connects to a server
after you've joined. Likewise, the number of times you've encountered a player
is equivalent to the number of times their data has been logged. This data is
sorted each time the player starts up Blockland. In the sorted file, each
encountered player is sorted by BLID, from smallest to largest. All names a
player of a specific BLID has been logged with will be listed.

By default, all data--raw and sorted--will be written to
"Blockland/config/client/playerArchive". This directory can be changed by
modifying "config.cs" (found in the same directory as this read-me).
